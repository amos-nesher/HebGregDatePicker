    /*
         This code was converted to Java Script from my VB.Net program
         to convert Hebrew dates to and from Gregorian dates. I avoided
         using many optimization in order to make the logic clearer.

         These functions assume that all the current rules of the
         Hebrew calendar were always in existence (which is not true
         since the Hebrew calendar was not always fixed) and all the
         current rules of the Gregorian calendar were always in existence
         (which is not true).

         Here is a very brief description of the Hebrew calendar.

         The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar.  This means that
         the months are in sync with the moon and the years stay in sync
         with the sun.  A solar year is approximately 365.25 days.  A
         lunar month is approximately 29.5 days.  Twelve lunar months is
         approximately 354 days (12 * 29.5=354).  Thus, a lunar year of
         twelve months is 11.25 days shorter than the solar year. To make
         up for this shortfall, the Hebrew calendar adds a thirteenth
         month to seven years over a nineteen year period. Therefore, over
         a nineteen year period, the Hebrew calendar is approximately the
         same length as a nineteen year solar calendar.

         In order to understand this code, you must know the following
         terms:
         Molad - new moon. Hebrew months start around the day of the
         new moon
         Chalakim - 1 / 1080 of an hour or 3 1/3 seconds
         Tishrei - the first month of the Hebrew year (at least for
         these calculations)
         Rosh Hashanah - The Jewish new year which starts on Tishrei 1.

         The Hebrew calendar assumes the period of time between one new
         moon to the next is 29 days, 12 hours and 793 chalakim. The first
         molad after creation occurred on Monday, September, 7th -3760 at 5
         hours and 204 chalakim.  Technically, the Gregorian date would be
         in the year 3761 BCE because there was no year 0 in the Gregorian
         calendar, but we will use the year of -3760.

         Sample Usage:
         // Converts AdarB/7/5765 to 4/6/2005
         alert(hebToGreg(5765, 7, 26))

    */

    // This function returns how many months there has been from the
    // first Molad until the beginning of the year nYearH
    function monSinceFirstMolad(nYearH) {
        var nMonSinceFirstMolad;

        // A shortcut to this function can simply be the following formula
        //   return Math.floor(((235 * nYearH) - 234) / 19)
        // This formula is found in Remy Landau's website and he
        // attributes it to Wolfgang Alexander Shochen. I will use a less
        // optimized function which I believe shows the underlying logic
        // better.

        // count how many months there has been in all years up to last
        // year. The months of this year hasn't happened yet.
        nYearH --;

        // In the 19 year cycle, there will always be 235 months. That
